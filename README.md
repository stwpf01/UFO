## Overview of Analysis

The pupose of this analysis was to expand the search to multiple filters instead of just the one on the [UFO Sightings webpage](). Originally it was only possible to search UFO sightings by date; now it is possible to search via City, State, Country, and Shape of the UFO. How the search works will be shown below.

### How To Use

To use the search, simply type within the proper search filter what one is looking for. For example, if one is looking for sightings in the city of El Cajon, type "el cajon" in the "Enter City" search filter. If one is looking for a light-shaped sighting, type "light" in the "Enter Shape" search filter. This same logic applies to the other search filters on the page.   

## Summary

While a good start to be able to search through the data, there are number of ways to improve the search. One of which is to allow the searcher to type using capital letters. Results will not be shown for El Cajon if "El Cajon" is typed in the search filter, only "el cajon" returns results. Another problem is typing the seach parameter into the wrong search bar. Searching for, say, a specific state in the date searchbar will not yield results, even if that state is in the data. Condensing the searchbar to a single one would help simplify searching. If one wants to specify where to look, the filters could be called via a drop-down menu instead of choosing the correct search bar. Finally, having sightings from other countries would be good, mainly for the reason that the "Enter Country" search bar is superfulous at this point in time.
